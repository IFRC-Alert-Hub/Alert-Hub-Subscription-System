Django Database Backup
=======================

Referenced from https://pypi.org/project/django-dbbackup/1.9.0/.

This Django application provides management commands to help backup and
restore your project database to AmazonS3, Dropbox or Local Disk.

* Keep your important data secure and offsite.
* Use Crontab or Celery to setup automated backups.
* Great to keep your development database up to date.

WARNING: Running 'dbrestore' will delete your current datatabase. Do not
attempt to run this command if you are not sure that you already have a
valid backup file.


MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
-------------------
dbbackup - Backup your database to the specified storage. By default this
will backup all databases specified in your settings.py file and
will not delete any old backups. You can optionally specify a
server name to be included in the backup filename.
>> dbbackup [-s <servername>] [-d <database>] [--clean] [--compress] [--encrypt]

dbrestore - Restore your database from the specified storage. By default this
will lookup the latest backup and restore from that. You may
optionally specify a servername if you you want to backup a
database image that was created from a different server. You may
also specify an explicit local file to backup from.
>> dbrestore [-d <database>] [-s <servername>] [-f <localfile>]

backup_media - Backup media files. Default this will backup the files in the MEDIA_ROOT.
Optionally you can set the DBBACKUP_MEDIA_PATH setting.
>> backup_media [--encrypt] [--clean] [--servername <servername>]


=======================
DBBackup to Amazon S3
=======================

In order to backup to Amazon S3, you'll first need to create an Amazon
Webservices Account and setup your Amazon S3 bucket. Once that is complete,
you can follow the required setup below.


SETUP YOUR DJANGO PROJECT
-------------------------
1. Install django-dbbackup and the required boto dependancy:
>> cd django-dbbackup
>> python setup.py install
>> pip install boto

2. Add 'dbbackup' to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py file.

3. Include the required settings below.
DBBACKUP_STORAGE = 'dbbackup.storage.s3_storage'
DBBACKUP_S3_BUCKET = '<amazon_bucket_name>'
DBBACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY = '<amazon_access_key>'
DBBACKUP_S3_SECRET_KEY = '<amazon_secret_key>'

4. Now you're ready to use the backup management commands.


AVAILABLE SETTINGS
------------------
DBBACKUP_S3_BUCKET (required)
The name of the Amazon S3 bucket to store your backups. This directory
must exist before attempting to create your first backup.

DBBACKUP_S3_ACCESS_KEY (required)
Your Amazon Account Access Key. This can be found on your Amazon Account
Security Credentials page. Note: Do not share this key with anyone you do
not trust with access to your Amazon files.

Should the S3 connection use SSL? Default is True


=====================
DBBackup to Dropbox
=====================

In order to backup to Dropbox, you'll first need to create a Dropbox Account
and set it up to communicate with the Django-DBBackup application. Don't
worry, all instructions are below.


SETUP YOUR DROPBOX ACCOUNT
--------------------------
1. Login to Dropbox and navigate to Developers Â» MyApps.
https://www.dropbox.com/developers/start/setup#python

2. Click the button to create a new app and name it whatever you like. For
reference, I named mine 'Website Backups'.

3. After your app is created, note the options button and more importantly
the 'App Key' and 'App Secret' values inside. You'll need those later.


SETUP YOUR DJANGO PROJECT
-------------------------
1. Install django-dbbackup and the required Python Dropbox Client API. If
using Pip, you can install this package using the following command:
>> cd django-dbbackup
>> python setup.py install
>> pip install dropbox

2. Add 'dbbackup' to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py file.

3. Include the required settings below.
DBBACKUP_STORAGE = 'dbbackup.storage.dropbox_storage'
DBBACKUP_TOKENS_FILEPATH = '<local_tokens_filepath>'
DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_APP_KEY = '<dropbox_app_key>'
DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_APP_SECRET = '<dropbox_app_secret>'

4. Now you're ready to use the backup management commands. The first time you
run a command you'll be prompted to visit a Dropbox URL to allow DBBackup
access to your Dropbox account.


AVAILABLE SETTINGS
------------------
DBBACKUP_TOKENS_FILEPATH (required)
The local filepath to store the Dropbox oAuth request and tokens. This file
will be auto-created, but should be treated like any other password to
access your website. NOTE: Do not share these keys with anyone you do not
trust with access to your Dropbox files.

DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_APP_KEY (required)
Required string containing your Dropbox App Key. NOTE: Do not share these
keys with anyone you do not trust with access to your Dropbox files.

DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_APP_SECRET (required)
Required string containing your Dropbox App Secret. NOTE: Do not share these
keys with anyone you do not trust with access to your Dropbox files.

DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TYPE (optional)
String containing your Dropbox Access Type. This is either 'dropbox' or
'app_folder' depending on the access type specified when creating your
application on the Dropbox website. This defaults to 'dropbox', assuming
your application has full access to your Dropbox folder.

DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_DIRECTORY (optional)
The directory in Dropbox you wish to save your backups. By default this is
set to '/django-dbbackups/'.


COMMON ERRORS
-------------
ERROR [403] 'The provided token does not allow this operation'
Creating an app in Dropbox defaults access to "app_folder" as opposed
to whole folder. Try changing the setting DBBACKUP_DROPBOX_ACCESS_TYPE
to 'app_folder'. (Ref: issue #9)



========================
DBBackup to Local Disk
========================

To store your database backups on the local filesystem, simply setup the
required settings below. Storing backups to local disk may also be useful for
Dropbox if you already have the offical Dropbox client installed on your
system.


SETUP YOUR DJANGO PROJECT
-------------------------
1. Install django-dbbackup application:
>> cd django-dbbackup
>> python setup.py install

2. Add 'dbbackup' to INSTALLED_APPS in your settings.py file.

3. Include the required settings below.
DBBACKUP_STORAGE = 'dbbackup.storage.filesystem_storage'
DBBACKUP_FILESYSTEM_DIRECTORY = '<local_directory_path>'

4. Now you're ready to use the backup management commands.


AVAILABLE SETTINGS
------------------
DBBACKUP_FILESYSTEM_DIRECTORY (required)
The directory on your local system you wish to save your backups.


========================
DBBackup to FTP
========================

To store your database backups on the remote filesystem via FTP, simply setup the
required settings below.

SETUP YOUR DJANGO PROJECT

DBBACKUP_FTP_HOST = 'ftp.host'
DBBACKUP_FTP_USER = 'user, blank if anonymous'
DBBACKUP_FTP_PASSWORD = 'password, can be blank'
DBBACKUP_FTP_PATH = 'path, blank for default'

4. Now you're ready to use the backup management commands.


AVAILABLE SETTINGS
------------------
DBBACKUP_FTP_HOST (required)
Hostname for the server you wish to save your backups.
DBBACKUP_FTP_USER, DBBACKUP_FTP_PASSWORD
FTP authorization credentionals. Skip for anonymous FTP.
DBBACKUP_FTP_PATH
The directory on remote FTP server you wish to save your backups.


===================
DATABASE SETTINGS
===================

The following databases are supported by this application. You can customize
the commands used for backup and the resulting filenames with the following
settings.

NOTE: The {adminuser} settings below will first check for the variable ADMINUSER
specified on the database, then fall back to USER. This allows you supplying a
different user to perform the admin commands dropdb, createdb as a different
user from the one django uses to connect. If you need more fine grain control
you might consider fully customizing the admin commands.

DBBACKUP_FORCE_ENGINE (optional)
By default, this app will look at DATABASES['default']['ENGINE'] to determine
if you are using MySQL, Postgres, or SQLite. If you want to skip this check
and force the app to use one of the three, set this value to onw of: mysql,
postgres, or sqlite.

DEFINING BACKUP COMMANDS
==========================

When creating backup or restore commands, there are a few template variables
you can use in the commands (listed below). Also note, ending a command with >
or < will pipe the file contents from or to the command respectively.

{databasename}: Name of the database from settings.py
{servername}: Optional SERVER_NAME setting in settings.py
{datetime}: Current datetime string (see DBBACKUP_DATE_FORMAT).
{extension}: File extension for the current database.

There are also two special commands READ_FILE and WRITE_FILE which take the
form of a two-item list, the second item being the file to read or write.
Please see the SQLite settings above for reference.



=================
GLOBAL SETTINGS
=================
DBBACKUP_STORAGE (required)
String pointing to django-dbbackup location module to use when performing a
backup. You can see the exact definitions to use in the required settings
for the backup location of your choice above.

DBBACKUP_SEND_EMAIL (optional)
Controls whether or not django-dbbackup sends an error email when an
uncaught exception is received. This is ``True`` by default.

DBBACKUP_DATE_FORMAT (optional)
The Python datetime format to use when generating the backup filename. By
default this is '%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S'.

DBBACKUP_SERVER_NAME (optional)
An optional server name to use when generating the backup filename. This is
useful to help distinguish between development and production servers. By
default this value is not used and the servername is not included in the
generated filename.

DBBACKUP_FILENAME_TEMPLATE (optional)
The template to use when generating the backup filename. By default this is
'{databasename}-{servername}-{datetime}.{extension}'. This setting can
also be made a method which takes the following keyword arguments:

def backup_filename(databasename, servername, timestamp, extension, wildcard):
pass

This allows you to modify the entire format of the filename based on the
time of day, week, or month. For example, if you want to take advantage of
Amazon S3's automatic expiry feature, you need to prefix your backups
differently based on when you want them to expire.

DBBACKUP_CLEANUP_KEEP (optional)
The number of backups to keep when specifying the --clean flag. Defaults to
keeping 10 + the first backup of each month.

DBBACKUP_GPG_RECIPIENT (optional)
The name of the key that is used for encryption. This setting is only used
when making a backup with the --encrypt option.

DBBACKUP_GPG_ALWAYS_TRUST (optional)
Always trust the gpg key (True), or not (False). The default value is False.
This setting is only used when making a backup with the --encrypt option.

DBBACKUP_MEDIA_PATH (optional)
The path that will be backed up by the 'backup_media' command. If this option
is not set, then the MEDIA_ROOT setting is used.


=====================
ENCRYPTION SETTINGS
=====================

You can encrypt a backup with the --encrypt option. The backup is done using gpg.
>> python manage.py dbbackup --encrypt

Requirements:
- Install the python package 'python-gnupg'
>> pip install python-gnupg
- You need gpg key.
- Set the setting 'DBBACKUP_GPG_RECIPIENT' to the name of the gpg key.

DBBACKUP_GPG_RECIPIENT (required)
Name of the gpg key used for encryption.

DBBACKUP_GPG_ALWAYS_TRUST (optional)
The encryption of the backup file fails if gpg does not trust the public
encryption key. The solution is to set the option 'trust-model' to 'always'.
By default this value is False. Set this to True to enable this option.
